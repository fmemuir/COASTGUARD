## :warning: PATCH NOTES :wrench:
- **28 October 2024**: Related to 23 Oct updates, the transect intersection with waterlines has been streamlined to try and speed up the process. This is in a new function `Transects.GetWaterIntersections()`. Users can still call the old/stable `Transects.GetBeachWidth()` if desired.
- **23 October 2024**: [CoastSat.slope](https://github.com/kvos/CoastSat.slope/) has now been implemented to get more robust per-transect slopes for tidal correction of waterlines, as opposed to the old way of a user-provided single slope value. You can opt to use this by writing in your driver file and then calling:
    ```
    beachslope = None
    ...
    TransectInterGDFWater = Transects.GetWaterIntersections(BasePath, TransectGDF, TransectInterGDF, WaterlineGDF, settings, output, beachslope)
    ```
    (or use the old method by providing an average value between 0.007 and 0.565, e.g. `beachslope = 0.01`).
- **14 October 2024**: Google Earth Engine has migrated all Landsat images from Collection 1 to Collection 2. This means the server names/paths have changed from `C01` to `C02`. This has been updated throughout the code, more details in [this issue thread](https://github.com/fmemuir/COASTGUARD/issues/18) and in [the GEE documentation](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/landsat_c1_to_c2).
- **26 June 2024**: Some new Sentinel-2 images no longer have the same quality assurance/masking band names (QA10, QA20, QA60). QA60 is used to generate cloud masks in pre-processing. An option has been added to use the new opaque cloud mask band name MSK_CLASSI_OPAQUE if QA60 isn't available. More details in [this issue thread](https://github.com/fmemuir/COASTGUARD/issues/13).
- **25 March 2024**: In response to the Copernicus Marine Service November 2023 updates, the wave data download functions have been overhauled ([more info here](https://marine.copernicus.eu/news/unveiling-exciting-updates-copernicus-marine-service-november-2023-release)). Use of Motu for downloading data has been discontinued, the in-house Copernicus client is now being used instead (which is only working via `pip` right now). **This requires the `copernicusmarine` package; if you created a `conda` environment for COASTGUARD prior to this update, add it to your `coastguard` environment with:**
    ```
    conda activate coastguard
    pip install copernicusmarine
    ```

- **28 February 2024**: Second update to the code in response to the same issue; location mismatches were found in the coastal buffer vs. satellite images, but only for Landsat imagery (see [this issue thread](https://github.com/fmemuir/COASTGUARD/issues/10) for more info). The reason is Landsat images are always stored in projection system UTM North (even if in the southern hemisphere), to avoid issues with images falling across the equator. A function to find correct UTM codes for a user's AOI has been included in [`Toolbox.py`](https://github.com/fmemuir/COASTGUARD/blob/master/Toolshed/Toolbox.py). **This requires the `utm` package; if you created a `conda` environment for COASTGUARD prior to this update, add it to your `coastguard` environment with:**
    ```
    conda activate coastguard
    conda install utm
    ```

- **21 February 2024**: Recent updates have been made to incorporate the AROSICS package into the COASTGUARD toolkit, to coregister satellite images after obtaining their metadata (and georeferencing info) from GEE. Implementing this led to knock-on changes that were made (namely a big update to `geemap`). See [this issue thread](https://github.com/fmemuir/COASTGUARD/issues/10) for more info. **This requires the `arosics` package and an update to the `geemap` package; if you created a `conda` environment for COASTGUARD prior to this update, add it to your `coastguard` environment with:**
    ```
    conda activate coastguard
    conda update geemap
    conda install arosics
    ```

- **January 2024**: Google have recently updated their authentication proces for using Earth Engine. You may be prompted to create an Earth Engine cloud project before you can generate a token for using Earth Engine within notebook environments. **Just call it something related like ee-coastguard.**





## Description and Scope
The goal of this toolkit is to have a fully operational framework for predicting coastal change, using machine learning techniques that are trained with satellite observations. With just one satellite image, multiple indicators of coastal change can be automatically extracted such as wave breaking zones, wet-dry boundaries, high water marks and vegetation edges. These automatically extracted indicators can then be fed into a machine learning network which makes future predictions based on the past changes and relationships between these indicators. The result is an automated, early warning system for coastal erosion at a potentially global scale.

## Enhancements
Various improvements have been made to the toolkit to address recent advancements in satellite-derived coastal monitoring, and to incorporate new Python packages and tools for more seamlessness. These are detailed further in the [methods paper](https://doi.org/10.1002/esp.5835), but include:

* ‚öôÔ∏è The use of geemap to download and process satellite imagery from Google Earth Engine entirely from within the cloud server;
* üìê Improved transect creation based on the Dynamic Coast project's Coastal Mapping Tools;
* üêº The use of geopandas to handle geospatial data (both loading in and exporting out) and for transect+shoreline intersections;
* ‚ÜîÔ∏è Beach width (the distance between vegetation edge and wet-dry line) extracted for each transect (based on calling of some of the original CoastSat functions to classify the water line);
* ‚òëÔ∏è Validation functions to quantify the error between satellite-derived vegetation edges and ground-truthed validation edges (from ground surveys or manual digitisation of aerial imagery);
* üìä Various plotting functions, such as violin plots for distances between satellite lines and validation lines, and GIFs of extracted edges and their respective satellite images.


## Installation

### **INSTALL QUICK VERSION**
1. Download repo: `$ git clone https://github.com/fmemuir/COASTGUARD.git`
2. Create conda environment: `conda env create -f coastguard_env.yml`
3. Activate env: `conda activate coastguard`
4. Authenticate GEE: `earthengine authenticate`

**Remember!**: Always run `conda activate coastguard` each time you want to use the toolbox. You *should not* need to authenticate `earthengine` each time, just the once when installing.


### 1.1 Download the code
The Python tool relies on packages downloaded through Anaconda and the Google Earth Engine API to run. The preliminary step is downloading this repository. You can do this either by clicking the <span style="color:white;background-color:#2EA043;">Code</span> button at the top and downloading + extracting the zipped folder, or by navigating to where you want to download it on your local machine and running 
```
git clone https://github.com/fmemuir/COASTGUARD.git
```
from a command line (if you have git command line tools installed).

If you downloaded the code zip file manually, it's recommended you extract the files to a new local folder rather than keeping it in your Downloads.

### 1.2 Create a conda enviroment

To run the toolbox you first need to install the required Python packages in an environment. If you don't already have it, **Anaconda** can be downloaded freely [here](https://www.anaconda.com/download/).

Once you have Anaconda installed on your PC:
- Windows: open the Anaconda Prompt (not Powershell)
- Mac and Linux: open a terminal window

and navigate to the folder with the repository files using `cd`. 

Navigate to the COASTGUARD repository folder (`cd COASTGUARD`) and then create a new `conda` environment named `coastguard` with all the required packages by entering this command (make sure you're in the repo folder!):
```
conda update -n base conda

conda env create --file coastguard_env.yml 
```
Note: the Python version listed in the .yml file is a dependent of the `pyfes` package (which is needed for tidal corrections of waterlines), see these issues [here](https://github.com/CNES/aviso-fes/issues/19) for details.

Then run this command to install the remaining packages:
```
conda install -c conda-forge earthengine-api pandas=2.0.3 geopandas spyder=5.5.0 geemap scikit-image matplotlib rasterio seaborn astropy geopy notebook netcdf4 arosics utm
```

Please note that solving and building the environment can take some time (minutes to hours *depending on the the nature of your base environment*). If you want to make things go faster, it's recommended you solve the conda environment installation with [Mamba](https://www.anaconda.com/blog/a-faster-conda-for-a-growing-community). You can set Mamba as the default conda solver with these steps:
```
conda update -n base conda

conda install -n base conda-libmamba-solver
conda config --set solver libmamba
```

Once the installation steps are complete, all the required packages will have been installed in an environment called `coastguard`. Always make sure that the environment is activated with:
```
conda activate coastguard
```
before you start working with the tools each time.


### 1.3 Activate Google Earth Engine API

This tool uses Google Earth Engine (GEE) API to access satellite image metadata. You need to request access to GEE API by signing up at [https://signup.earthengine.google.com/](https://signup.earthengine.google.com/) with a Google account and filling in a few questions about your intended usage (the safest bet is 'research'). It can take up to 24 hours to approve a request, but it's usually fairly quick. 

In the meantime, you will also need to install a program called Google Cloud Command Line Interface (gcloud CLI). It shouldn't matter where you download this to. Find installation instructions here: [https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install). 

Once your GEE request has been approved, you should get a confirmation email. Open a prompt/terminal window and `activate coastguard` environment. Run this command to link your `conda` environment to the GEE server:

```
earthengine authenticate
```

A web browser will open; log in with the GMail account you used to sign up to GEE. The authenticator should then redirect back to your terminal window. If it doesn't, copy+paste the authorization code into the terminal.


## Getting Started

The process of extracting coastal vegetation edges from satellite data is run through a driver file. Driver files can be customised for your own site of interest. There are a couple of template examples in the repository to help you get started. 
The interactive python notebook [`VedgeSat_DriverTemplate.ipynb`](https://github.com/fmemuir/COASTGUARD/blob/master/VedgeSat_DriverTemplate.ipynb) can be viewed and executed in an interactive notebook environment such as jupyter-notebook which can be launched at the command line:
```
(coastguard) $ jupyter-notebook VedgeSat_DriverTemplate.ipynb
```
Alternatively, you can customise and run the standard python script [`VedgeSat_DriverTemplate.py`](https://github.com/fmemuir/COASTGUARD/blob/master/VedgeSat_DriverTemplate.py) using a Python IDE such as Spyder:
```
(coastguard) $ spyder VedgeSat_DriverTemplate.py
```
https://github.com/fmemuir/COASTGUARD/assets/22475417/1bd4722b-ece9-4ed9-a9ac-104f71c241d7

There are 7 main steps to setting up the vegetation extraction tool. These steps are run from a driver file which takes care of all the user-driven params when setting up a new site. The main steps found in a driver file are:

1. Import relevant packages (including initialising the `earthengine` tools);
2. Define an area of interest. For the time being, this must be **smaller than 262144 (512 x 512) pixels**, equivalent to 5.12 x 5.12 km for Sentinel and 7.68 x 7.68 km for Landsat;
3. Define image parameters (start and end date, satellites, CRS/projections, sitename);
4. Retrieve and save image collection metadata*;
5. Set coastal boundary parameters (cloud cover threshold, plotting flags, minimum area for contouring);
6. Define a reference shore along which to create a buffer (boundaries will only be extracted along here);
7. Run the main edge extraction function.

*<sub>This is an update from the original CoastSat toolkit! Raw satellite images will **not** be downloaded, but merely the filenames will be passed to `geemap` and converted from the cloud server straight to `numpy` arrays. This is to save time and bandwidth. TIFs of true colour images and their classified and NDVI counterparts are exported by default throughout the process to be explored in a GIS environment. To turn this off, run `extract_veglines(metadata, settings, polygon, dates, savetifs=False)`</sub>

The tool takes all the input settings the user has defined, and performs these steps:

1. Preprocess each image in the metadata collection (downsample or pansharpen, mask clouds, clean nodata);
2. Create buffer around reference shoreline (or most recent shore extracted, useful for dynamic shores and image collections over a long period);
3. Classify image using the pre-trained neural network; 
4. Show/adjust detected boundary between image classes (depending on if user has requested to be shown the interactive plot window);
5. Export boundaries and relevant metadata to a `.pkl` file and a shapefile of lines.

### Extracting Waterlines Alongside Vegetation Edges
As this tool is built from the original CoastSat toolkit, it is possible to extract instantaneous waterlines as well as vegetation edges from each satellite image. To do this, change the `wetdry` flag in the user requirements to `True`. Any tidal correction on the extracted waterlines is performed using the FES2014/FES2022 tidal model. You will need to use pyFES and the Aviso FES repo for this. 

To get the tide data set up for the newer version FES2022, follow [this helpful CoastSat guide](https://github.com/kvos/CoastSat/blob/master/doc/FES2022_setup.md). **Note: you don't need to change the filepaths in the .yaml file as is listed in these steps! The function `ChangeYAMLPaths()` in [`Toolbox.py`](https://github.com/fmemuir/COASTGUARD/blob/master/Toolshed/Toolbox.py) does this for you the first time you run `ComputeTides()`.**

To set up the older FES2014 model, follow these steps:
1. **Clone** the repo from [the aviso-fes github](https://github.com/CNES/aviso-fes). 
2. You will notice the folders in */aviso-fes/data/fes2014* are empty. You need to get the actual tide data from the AVISO file transfer service by signing up to their [FTP subscription here](https://www.aviso.altimetry.fr/en/data/data-access/registration-form.html) and ticking "FES2014 / FES2012 (Oceanic Tides Heights)" under the *Auxiliary products* requested.
3. Once you have been approved and given access to their file transfer service, you can use whichever file transfer program (we like FileZilla, or you can use `ftp` at the command line) to download the files below:
    - eastward_velocity.tar.xz
    - load_tide.tar.xz
    - northward_velocity.tar.xz
    - ocean_tide.tar.xz
    - ocean_tide_extrapolated.tar.xz
You'll find these in the AVISO Altimetry database under */auxiliary/tide_model/fes2014_elevations_and_load/*
4. Decompress the archives (using 7zip or alternatives) and move them into the relevant folders in your local */aviso-fes/data/fes2014* directory (that you cloned in Step 1).

When loading in the tidal data in the COASTGUARD driver file, you should **change the tidal files path `tidepath` to wherever you have cloned the aviso-fes repo to on your machine.**

### CoasTrack Outputs
The `CoasTrack` module outputs a series of shapefiles and `.pkl` files representing cross-shore transect intersections with various remotely sensed coastal metrics. The code documentation has tried to explain the origin and abbreviations of each variable and attribute field heading. However if you would like a full description in one place, the [CoasTrack_README.txt](https://github.com/fmemuir/COASTGUARD/blob/master/CoasTrack_README.txt) file has descriptions of the contents of these datasets.

## Roadmap
This code is live and the master branch is being updated often (daily to weekly). If you clone this repo, please update it regularly with `git pull`!

**May 2025:** The PhD thesis associated with this toolshed has been handed in! Moving forward, changes will be more minor and issue-focused.
